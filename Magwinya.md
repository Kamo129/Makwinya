Overview
This program allows the user to input three temperature readings from a fryer and makes recommendations based on the temperature differences between the first and second readings. It also determines whether or not the fryer is ready for cooking Magwinyas (a type of fried dough).

Features
Input temperature readings: The program takes three temperature readings from the user.
Temperature analysis: Based on the difference between the first and second readings, the program will provide instructions to either reduce or increase the fryer heat before proceeding to the third reading.
Fryer readiness check: After the third reading, the program calculates the total temperature and informs the user if the oil is ready for frying (temperature between 150 and 190 degrees).
Program Flow
The user is prompted to enter the first temperature reading.
The user is then prompted to enter the second temperature reading.
The program calculates the temperature difference between the first and second readings:
If the difference is greater than 50, the program advises reducing the fryer heat and exits.
If the difference is less than 10, the program advises increasing the fryer heat and exits.
If the difference is acceptable, the user is prompted to enter the third temperature reading.
The program calculates the total temperature and checks if the fryer is ready for frying based on the third reading.
